                <h2>Rotation Notes</h2>
                <p>As a BLM your elemental spells are Fire, Ice and Thunder. Fire is your primary damage element, Ice is your supportive element and Thunder is your damage over time (DoT) element. They all serve their own important roles. It is important to understand when to use each spell.</p>

            <h3>White Mage</h3>
            <p>White magic, the arcane art of succor, was conceived eras past that the world might know comfort. Alas, man began perverting its powers for self-gain, and by his wickedness brought about the Sixth Umbral catastrophe. Although the art subsequently became forbidden, it is now in the midst of a revival at the hands of the Padjal, chosen of the elementals.</p>

                <h2>Rotation Notes</h2>
                <p>As a WHM there is no set skill rotation throughout the battle, it is entirely situational. There is some preparation work that will help you maximise your potential however. Protect should always be on all of your party members and Stoneskin should also be cast between fights. Upon engaging the monster cast Aero II to apply the damage over time effect.</p>
